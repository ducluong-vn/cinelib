# Introduction
A website similar to [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/), all APIs are from themoviedb's public APIs. UI of this website was designed carefully in Figma, i tried to make the UI as friendly and as minimal as possible. This pure react project was bootstrapped by create-react-app with some little modifications.
